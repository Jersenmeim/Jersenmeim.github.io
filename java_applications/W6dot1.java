Tells the user what the program does.
Prompts the user to an investment amount, for example, 1000.
Gets the user's input and saves it. The user's input must be a positive, non-zero value.
Prompts the user to enter an annual interest rate, for example, 9%.
Gets the user's input and saves it. The user's input must be positive and less than 100.
Using a method that you have written, calculate and display the future value of the investment
for a period of 10 years. The formula for computing the future value of an investment is

futureValue = investmentAmount x (1 + monthlyInterestRate)numberOfYears * 12

The method header for your method should look like this:

public static double futureValue(double investmentAmount, double monthlyInterestRate, int years)

Here is an example of what your program should look like when it runs (user input is in green):

Given an investment amount and an annual interest rate, this program
will calculate the future value of the investment for a period of
ten years.

Enter the a positive, non-zero value for the investment: 1000
Enter an annual interest rate, between 0 and 100: 9

Years   Future Value
1       $1093.81
2       $1196.41
3       $1308.65
4       $1431.41
5       $1565.68
6       $1712.55
7       $1873.20
8       $2048.92
9       $2241.12
10      $2451.36
